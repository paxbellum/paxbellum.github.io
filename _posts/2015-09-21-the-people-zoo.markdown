Come on in, see the attractions

Oh what sights you will see

The curiosities

The horrors

The grotesque

Repugnant forms

From another age

Lost in time and space

Preserved for eternity

For you to gaze upon

Unable to evolve

Atrocities forsaken by their own neglect

Extinction would have been kinder

They do not belong

Anywhere

Anytime

Welcome to the People Zoo

Please enjoy your visit
