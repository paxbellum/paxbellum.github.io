Hi
Hello, how do you feel?
Hmm, a bit… well, off. Not bad, just not quite like myself.
Well that’s understandable. You’ve had an accident.
An accident? What happened? I don’t feel anything. Am I in shock?
Well yes and no. You don’t feel any pain, but you might be having trouble adjusting. 
What do you mean adjusting?
Well you see, you didn’t make it. You died. 
I died? Are you sure, because well, I don’t feel dead. 
What do you suppose death would feel like?
I guess I really don’t know, just somehow I thought it would be different.
Yes, most people do. 
So, who are you? Are you death?
Yes I am.
Have you come for my soul?
In a manner. 
Oh, do you want something else? Does it take long?
I just wanted to talk for a bit. 
What would you like to talk about?
About you.
What about me?
Well how are you doing? It’s quite a big transition. Most people have questions. Do you have any?
Let’s see, well I guess I’m wondering what happens now?
It’s a strange process that is different for everyone. 
Different how?
Well everyone has different expectations, and here those expectations shape themselves into being. 
Oh I see, that sounds well complex. 
Yes, it is. What is it that you want to happen now?
I’m not sure. I guess I would like to go to heaven, can I?
If that is what you want, then yes you can go. 
I guess I am confused about what choices there are, what else could happen? I mean, I don’t want to go to hell. You won’t send me there will you?
No, not if you don’t want to go. 
Well I guess then I want to go to heaven, can I go now?
Of course you can, it’s all up to you. 
I hope it’s fun. I think mostly I can’t wait to see my father, I’ve missed him terribly. 
Yes, well then I guess if you concentrate on that existence it will begin, this process is entirely dependent upon you. 
Oh, well then what do I do?
What are you thinking about?
Right now, I am thinking about my friends and family. I wonder if they will miss me. I miss them. 
Well it seems that if you have built these relationships with friends and family, they will certainly miss you. 
Yes, I suppose you are right. I feel bad.
Why?
Well I imagine that they are sad. I was sad when my father died. Now they probably feel like that. 
Yes, they probably do. 
I wish I could help them. I don’t want them to feel sad. 
Yes, it’s difficult to lose someone. But it’s part of life, more specifically it’s part of a good life. 
What do you mean it’s part of a good life?
Well as far as I understand the concept of life, we could define a good life as one in which people are happy. They have family and friends, husbands and wives and kids. These things give more meaning and bring so much happiness that any person that has these things must have lived a good life. The pain and sadness of losing is because there was so much happiness to lose. 
Yes, I see. I guess that makes a certain sense. 
Yes, it’s not always the case. Some people come and they are happier to be here than they were there. They feel as though they haven’t really lost much at all. 
That sounds terrible. They must have had a pretty miserable life. 
Maybe. But this time is about you. What do you want to happen now?
Well, I guess I am still uncertain. I mean I have started to accept that I have died, but thinking about my family and friends, I really love them a lot and I miss them. All I want right now is to see them again. To show them that I had a great life with them, and that they don’t have to be sad.
Yes I see, well unfortunately that can’t happen. I can’t take you back to see them, it gets a little messy, paperwork and all. You know how bureaucracies are. 
That’s too bad, I really liked the idea of seeing everyone again. I had so many good times, I think I will really miss those times. 
Yes, I see. Well I can’t give those times back to you, but perhaps… there is something else. 
What do  you mean something else?
Well I can’t give those old times back to you, but what do you think about trying to make new ones?
You mean to create new experiences and happiness?
Yes, that’s what I mean.
But how?
Well, how would you feel about trying it again?
Trying what? Life? How do you do it again?
Well it wouldn’t be the life that you knew, that is old. This would be new. New experiences. New family. New friends. New happiness. What do you think, are you ready to try it again?
Yes…
