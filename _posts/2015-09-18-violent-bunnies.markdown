In large citizens of a particular society gain experience, and possibly wisdom through experience. Learned by degrees, perhaps I should say by days, of living. Through good and bad experiences. We learn that the fantasies of TV writers portrayed to us through actors are just that, fantasies. This world of fiction, while often entertaining, has little bearing on the real world, real people, or real consequences to action.  I believe that the vast majority of people understand this, because if they didn’t we would all probably be dead by now. Killed by racing down the highway at speeds that are unmanageable by most of us to control a hurtling object of metal at speeds in excess of100mph. Or shot, stabbed, poisoned or any other of the millions of way sto die, by accident or volition of another person. 

We, as a people, as humans understand that television violence is fictitious violence, and has not part in our daily lives beyond perverse entertainment. 

UNfortunately there are impressionable people in society too. Well, we probably all are at various stages, usually while gaining experience and learning what constitutes the difference between fun and stupidity. 

I remember watching bugs bunny and daffy duck playing their antics on saturday mornings when I was growing up. Or, one of my favorites marvin the martian. They were ridiculous, and stupid and so very fun to watch. I was enthralled beyond belief. 

Never once did it seem credible to me that real people could survive the same mishaps as these immortal characters that were rarely fazed by the violence expended on them. Back firing guns, explosions of dynamite, falling rocks and debris, open platforms located in the vastness of outer space without atmosphere or gravity. They were not mortal. They could shrug off gun shot wounds with a quip and a quick exit to reappear a moment later, the picture of cartoonish health. 

THe spectacle of violence in movies and tv is unnatural, outside a state of war. Even during real bloodshed there is pain and loss, the constant reminder of what violence can do to us. The ever present ramifications for our choices to participate in violence and its very real and present cost to our bodies and our psyche. 

When we lose, or perhaps never form, the ability to distinguish between real and fake violence; when we don’t consider the consequences of action and choice. We give permission to engage in dangerous behavior that is exciting and fun for the thrill, we fool ourselves. Maybe we will get lucky once or twice, but it won’t last. Sooner or later natural law sets in. The law of consequence. Of sequence. We will cause harm to ourselves or somebody else. At the point it is already too late, we should have already been schooled in the the rules of causation, of cause and effect. They relate to every decision we make, and the possible outcomes of these decisions.
