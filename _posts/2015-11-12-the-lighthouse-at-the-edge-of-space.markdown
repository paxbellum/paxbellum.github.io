Out among the stars, galaxies and universes swirling around, there is a singular lighthouse at the edge of space. It marks a demarcation boundary.

Between what is possible and what is impossible

Asteria liked the impossible

The possible was a bit boring

Everyone already knew what was possible

They did not, however, know what was impossible

Early on, Asteria recognized that her fellow friends  and classmates were not liker

Nor she like them. 

They had very practical ideas

Even when they played, and imagined and had fantastical thoughts

They were practical fantasies

And Asteria decided she did not want to be a practical person

Her dreams were impractical and she also should be if she were to realize them

She dreamed so big that everything seemed possible and easy 

Because she was preparing for the impossible

It required daring and both imagination and ingenuity

To be so fantastical and beyond the pale 

Clearing new paths for those to follow

But none had, or would, ever lead her

S one day off she set in the Anemoi

Headed for the farthest reaches of space

Looking for a spot just past a point in the known universe

She was looking for the unknown universe

Something, someplace that no one had ever seen before

Somewhere impossible

She traveled for so long

It was lonely and dull

Countless decades spent alone

Dreaming in a capsule that kept her alive

But asleep

And she dreamed

Oh, she dreamed the most delightful dreams

Of what she might find

Of what was waiting for her

Of that special spectacular spot at the edge of space

The new, the fantastic, the impossible

That’s what drover her

Finally, decades, centuries, eons later

She arrived

There

The somewhere she had dreamed about for so long

And the only reason that she knew that it was the place

There was a lighthouse

Which is kind of a silly thing 

To have way out in space

It was, silly, it was impractical, it was impossible

She had arrived

She read the palacard

Please heed its warning

For if you venture past it, well, who knows what might happen. 

And so she stepped off…
