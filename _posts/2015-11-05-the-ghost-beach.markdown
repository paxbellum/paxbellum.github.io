So I am going to tell you a ghost story. 

I know I know it’s just past the season of Halloween and we’ve probably all had our fill of ghost stories. This story in particular is a different kind of ghost story. The ghost is not of a person, but a place. Before you ask, how can a place be a ghost it was never alive, how could it have died. 
This story is the story of a beach, or a reasonable facsimile of a beach. It came into being as an entity in the collective memories of people that had visited this beach for years, decades, centuries maybe even eons. It was a very old beach. It had witnessed love and happiness. It had seen despair and loneliness. All of these experiences banded together to form, in essence, the soul of the beach. It became aware. It collected memories and experiences. It was a gathering place for the young and jubilant to celebrate and a haven for the old to reminisce. These experiences, these memories dripped off its visitors, they pooled and coalesced then and slowly filled each and every particle of sand that comprised this particular beach. 
Over the years, decades, centuries and eons it had absorbed so much that it became hard to contain it all. Slowly these memories of lives and people were reflected to be played out time and time again. 
The beach became haunted with these memories. 
And it became forlorn. 
All of these lives that it saw always seemed to progress in one particular way, loss and the absence of everything. 
It became aware that the kids running up and down the little sand dunes and splashing playfully in the water, that screeched with delight when waves washed over them and cried as sandcastles were overrun to crumble back on itself, were the same people that would return month after month and year after year. At first the people were always filled with frivolity and hope and desire, they hungered for the future and what they could pluck from life. 
And later on they came back, stooped with age and worry. Shambling from the weight of regret and the loss of hope. They came back to try to rekindle that hope. Hope that had long fled. They hoped that sand they that the tread upon was imbued with their lost hope. And combing the beach would bring it back. 
The beach saw this routine repeated in person after person and replayed year after year, decade after decade. 
And the beach, it became sad. 
It lost joy and frivolity. 
It knew that these things were temporary, that in the end these empty husks of desiccated people always returned, because they had nowhere else to go. 
They had nothing to look forward to. No new experiences, no new love, and no more hope. 
So the beach, it lost hope too. 
It became merely a remnant of the beach it once was. Sadness that had seeped into every kernel and grain was let loose to flow freely from one end to the other. 
Families stopped coming, children no longer shrieked with delight. It was no longer a sunny welcoming place, it was cold and gloomy. It was spooky. 
It was haunted. 
And the beach, left to its sadness, its sorrow formed from a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand memories, could stand it no longer. 
And it died. 
It willed itself out of existence. 

And all the trapped memories were released. 

These memories had nowhere to go. They could not perambulate, they could not fly. They could not move. 
So they stayed. 
And congealed into an entity that had once resembled the beach. 
But different. 
It was miserable. 
It feared. 
It hated. 

And mostly it hated people. 
Not the bothersome annoyed kind, where it just bothered and wants you to go away. 
It wants to repay its agony by causing it in others. 
It wants blood. 
It wants your very soul. 

But it will never be appeased, it will always want more. 
And that is what it got. 

The world weary would stop.
The soul searchers still. 

They would sit on the benches and gaze into the ocean. 
Sounds muted, vision cloudy. They relived all the worst parts of their lives. 
Crying indistinctly on the benches, alone. 
Devoid of hope. 

Their breathing slowed. 
Their hearts stopped. 
Their souls imprisoned.
