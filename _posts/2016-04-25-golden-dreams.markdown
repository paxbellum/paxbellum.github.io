A windy night blew in
Storm clouds rolling across the sky
No land in sight
You could see the ripples lap across the water

The wind whipped into the sails 
They billowed
Full
And the ship surged

It had been weeks since any wind had touched these sails
Adrift, it had floated in the midst of nothingness
Like its crew
Without direction
Neither coming or going
Just here

Captain O’donnel smiled his biggest smile
Underway at last
The weeks had been pure torture
Stranded, struffling to fish for food that had run out and collect water that was brackish
The crew became fascinated with life under the water
Under the sea
They watched all day, as long as the sun was in the sky
As life played out underneath
They watched, removed, as if in purgatory

Waves on the horizon
Pushed in by the wind
A squall, a white squall
Came barrelling intot he side of the ship
Rocking it
Explosions of water geysered around the ship
And waves beat against it

To the far east they had set sail
South to africa
All around the horn
And back up

The pacific was a world unto itself
Even a universe
Limitless it seemd, unexplored mostly

The charters (maps) were incomplete
They had been sailing blind
For a week when the wind stopped

They could have traveresed into a parallel universe for all they knew

That was the problem right know
They just didn’t know
Nobody did

Adventure
It was all for the sake of adventure
Sure it sounded good
Even looked good on paper
With its precise writing, neat sentences and perfect punctuation

But the reality was
Adventure was 90% waiting and boredom
And the remaining 10% was pure danger
Like this shit will probably kill you so pray to the gods of luck that something ridiculous will keep you alive long enough to get back to the boredom which you so desperately miss at this very moment
It was always that last little bit that made it so much fun
And to be fair, danger is exciting, adventurous even

So the wind was back
Hope renewed to full effect
Melancholy displaced with dreams of fortunes and plans

The oracle had promised the captain he would find great riches on this voyage

Goldy beyond belief

A shout from the scout at the crow’s nest
Tidal wave
All hands secure yourselves

The tidal wave with a roar of wet dripping hell descended on the ship

Timbers shook, quailed and shorn
Joints ripped apart
The ship collapsed to entropy, in upon itself
It almost seemed to vanish
Broken into so many small pieces

O’donnell was trapped 
Trapped by his little chest of treasures
That had captured his clothing and wouldn’t let go
He couldn’t get free
And as the ship split apart and the floor disappeared he fell
Dragged under by his own treasure and greed

Quickly he descended the depths
Frantically he kept trying to free himself
To no avail

His lungs burning he couldn’t hold ou tmuch longer
His limbs grew sluggish
Darkness was closing in

And below him
Seeming to float up from the depths
Was an ancient ship
Of no recognizable design
Massive, huge, a behemoth
That had endured a similiar fate millenia ago
And all around was strewn gold and treasure
O’donnell had found it at last
And with a chuckle
He released the last bit of air 
And welcomed cold water
Content that he would lie here buried for eternity
With his found treasure and wealth
