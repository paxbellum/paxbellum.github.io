As the snow fell across the city, light fluffy slowly it meandered its way down form the heavens to blanket the city in its soft white canopy. Now something strange happens to cities covered in snow. THey get quiet. Really quiet. It’s like all the snow has muffled the collective will of people to be, well, people. They become quiet. They don’t go out. The settle down. I guess really its sort of a very temporary and quick hibernations. The snow puts people to sleep. They drowse indoors snoozing away to the festive singing of holiday music, parades or the local news which seems to incessantly talk about the snow, as if we really didn’t know it was there to begin with. 

SO while all these slumbering people have retreated inside their cozy little dens of warmth and noise, that’s when I like to go out. To go exploring. The city in the snowfall is beautiful. Luminescent. Light up by reflected light bouncing all around you. THe city glows. It’s magical. It’s quiet. Nobody else wants to go out. I feel almost alone. There is the stray car, the stray animal perhaps but mostly its me in my solitude. It’s like my own personal playground. I can go where I want, do what I want. Fresh snow covers everything, it blurs edges it makes a surreal landscape. A white frosted fairyland to frolic in. 

I like to walk by the rivers. Yes, there are two. There is something mesmerizing about watching the reflection of snow merge into the water and consume itself. THe cold air lends a crispness to perception and feeling. The cold is invigorating. 

While I stand at the edge of the water staring at my reflection I imagine another world, like hoth. Its cold and snowy of course. And deserted. Am I the last person. This city all to myself. What would I do if I were truly alone in this city of mine. There’s a dizzying array of mischief that comes to mind. 

Really the first thing I want to do is get a sled and go sled down the hills on colfax the main thoroughfare through the heart of the city. Just being able to enjoy a really long fast sled ride.  THere are stores to explore. Adventure. It seems unadventurous to try to have adventure without interacting with people. 

I wonder if the animals would still be in the zoo. Talk about some adventure. Let them all loose? Perhaps not at the same time. That seems disastrous. But it would make things more exciting. 

So parallel cold worlds aside as I reflect on my reflection and visions of alternate worlds populated by freed zoo animals comes and go, it offers a good chance for self reflection. 

You know the questions. Where am I? What am I doing? Am I happy? What do I want to do?

Its the perspective that’s different though, different from looking in the mirror. It’s straight cut answer as you have a reflection looking directly back at you. 

Reflections in rivers, late at night in the cold add mystery and uncertainty. They allow the mind to wander, to speculate about all of the other things you could be doing if only you were less encumbered, if you were braver, of all those desires you want to follow up on, but in the warm daylight you can’t bring yourself to do. This is a time for whimsy after all, for imagining what its like to be different than you are. Of longing for the things you want and of remembering all the things you’ve lost. It’s a good time for tears, alone, on the riverfront. No one to see you. 

It’s a release. It’s freedom, from your mind from yourself, if only for a moment. Coming out of reverie hands frozen and feet asleep you chaff them to warm them up and stamp your feet to get circulation going. The musings of the last hour already starting to fade. They would be missed if remembered, but that time is past. As I turn back for home, a little song has bloomed in my heart, the night waxes serene and offers comfort as I hum to myself and wonder why I am thinking about  escaped zoo animals.
