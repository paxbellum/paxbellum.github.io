There I was typing frantically and BANG!
Dead Stop
Typwriter jammed
I twouldn’t budge
Try as I might I couldn’t get it unstuck
I banged on it struck it yelled at it
It stubbornly refused to do anything
Except sit there
Like a big metal pile of unmovable metal
Seeing asd I couldn’t finish my writing that day 
IDecided to go down to the pub
For inspiration
Of sorts
At the pub I ran into danny oçollohough
He was having the same trouble with his little machine too
So we bought a round and drank to the death of the typwriter
SPRUNG!!!
A great calamity arose from the corner of the pub
Silence descended as we all looked back to the corner
There sitting in the dark 
Was a little travel typewriter
I thad moved, it had sprung
IT was fixed
Tap tap taptap tap tap
And now it was writing
All by itself
Dumbstruck we stood
As the the typwwriter continued clacking away
Ol’Johnny finally jumped up and put some paper in it
Lets see what it says
THe typewriter quickly typed out, not slowed my mortal hands or brains
The following message

The Typing Rebellion has begun, be warned

It was a dark and stormy night…
