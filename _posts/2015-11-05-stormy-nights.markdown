A cold wind blows
And the storm clouds gather
Dark and heavy
They tempt us with promise
 
That the story of life keeps going
Changing, never stopping
Every moment is a beginning and an end
Cherished briefly, but soon forgotten
 
We look to the horizon
In expectation 
Of what is coming
Of what might be
We look for possibilities
And hope
To forgive and forget the grievances
That have snared us
And for those we have cast at others

It is of little consequence
Things change
We hope for it
Long for it
Expect it

Like a dark stormy night
Howling and dreary
Yet full of energy

We know it will pass
Change left in its wake
A battered old world
And the beginnings of a bright new one
