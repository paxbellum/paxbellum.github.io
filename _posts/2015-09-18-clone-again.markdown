title: Clone Again
layout: post
---
Ever have that day when you are so lazy you wish you had someone else, just like you, albeit with a bit more energy; just a little, enough to make it all the way over to the remote that got accidentally left on the side table that is three feet away, instead of the coffee table that is a mere foot away. How can one possibly cover that kind of space. 

Its easy, get a clone! They can be your new best friend. Make them do your chores. Like getting the aforementioned remote from that table. Need an organ donor? Now you can have one with you wherever you go. Never leave home without one. 

Can’t make friends, make your own with the new replicate yourself system. It’s only a button push away. 

Can’t decide on a new hair style or which medication will work better for you. Now you can have your own self-contained testing laboratory in the comfort of your own home. 

Want to finish that yard work faster or build an addition to your home without the expensive costs of labor? Sure you do, who doesn’t? 

Act fast before international humanitarian law becomes enforced in your area. Better yet, replicate yourself to increase the vote and make yourselves heard!
