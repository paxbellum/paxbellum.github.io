What if?

This is the sound of rebellion. This is how it starts.  Hope. Dreaming of a better tomorrow. Rebellion and revolution somewhere at sometime acquired these negative connotations. That there is something wrong with them. Well maybe there is if they are directed at you. But the purpose is of revolt and rebellion is to change, for the better, something, some system that is not working for many many people.
