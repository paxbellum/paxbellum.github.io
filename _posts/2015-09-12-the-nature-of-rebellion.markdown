What if?

This is the sound of rebellion. This is how it starts.  Hope. Dreaming of a better tomorrow. Rebellion and revolution somehwere at sometime acquired these negative connotations. That there is something wrong with them. Well maybe there is if they are directed at you. But the purpose is of revolt and rebellion is to change, for the better, something, some system that is not working for many many people. 

Rebel without a cause, not really. There is always a cause, perhaps you just don’t see it, don’t agree with it. It doesn’t mean its not there. 

Of course, a well-schooled progressive of today might prefer, in place of such diffident heroics, the words of Mario Savio in 1964:
There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.
Or some of the strategies recommended by Howard Zinn:
A determined population can not only force a domestic ruler to flee the country, but can make a would-be occupier retreat, by the use of a formidable arsenal of tactics: boycotts and demonstrations, occupations and sit-ins, sit-down strikes and general strikes, obstruction and sabotage, refusal to pay taxes, rent strikes, refusal to cooperate, refusal to obey curfew orders or gag orders, refusal to pay fines, fasts and pray-ins, draft resistance, and civil disobedience of various kinds .... Thousand of such instances have changed the world but they are nearly absent from the history books.
