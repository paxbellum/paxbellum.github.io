Ever wonder where all your spare time goes?
You know, when you suddenly realize that you have wasted the day doing nothing. 
That was me. 
No, seriously, that was me. 
I stole it. 

Now before you get mad, hear me out. 
I need it. 

Without it I would perish. 
I would cease to exist. 

All I ask for is those little bits and pieces of time.
You aren’t really using them. 
You don’t need them. 
I do. 

You aren’t missing them, you barely notice they are gone. 
Think of it as a symbiotic relationship. 
You give and I take.

What do you get?
I take away the banality of your day to day existence. 
It’s not so bad you think?

Really think about it. 
Come on.
Give it some thought. 

Instead of a nice ebb and flow to your routine and existence, you become acutely aware of every single moment of every single hour of every single day. 

Surely you are not that interesting. 
I saw you. You were picking your nose and inspecting the goo that was oozing out from under your fingernail. 
Seriously you spent ten whole minutes, just doing that. 
But you don’t remember that. I took that time. To you, nothing happened. THe passage of time hopped over that. 
Do you really want to remember that? Or the other million times that has happened? How about cleaning sweaty lint from between your toes. 
Is that time you really feel like you are missing out on?

Doesn’t seem to me like you are missing much. 
But that time, that time keeps me alive. 
Alive and kicking for ten more minutes, hours, days. 

How about when you are sick. I mean really sick. Hacking up phlegm, puking blood, shit in your pants in your bed kind of sick. 
Do you want that time back?
Do  you want to remember every second of that misery. The second by second torture of time that never moves forward. The hell that lies between the seconds unwilling to progress. 

That’s what I need. 
That’s what I take. 
That’s what I devour, for both of us.
