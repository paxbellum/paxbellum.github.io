You drive me crazy I say
Please oh please oh please just go away
But I want you to stay

Is this because I went ahead and named the dog Mort?
And all along I thought it was fun sport
Turn about is fair play, you retort

I can’t believe you actually called me a bore
I’m sorry its not all fun and games anymore
And when the fuck did I begin to resemble Al Gore?

Your lifestyle is starting to make you a little cray
All you want to do is play all day
Its all just too much you relay

Why live each and every day like I’m a nun
Stuck in an office, give me a gun
Life itself, it should be about fun

You, you’re all idle chatter and you never make sense
Where’s your ambition make it come hither make it come hence
With all your procrastination you’ve built up a fence

Surely you’re joking, you must be in jest
Was this all you had to get off your chest
Sure we can stop now and give it a rest
