The concept of Peace and War is old trope, for sure. Militarily the concept is well ingrained both historically and in modernity. Eve in literature we can see the war of man and his psyche. The struggle of life's adventure can often wreak havoc upon individuals. The purpose of struggle then is conflict juxtaposed with its absence. 

The point of struggle, assumed, is to overcome conflict. And stories about people are about the process, that resolution, that comes at the end of the conflict. We can, and often, struggle more with ourselves than outside influences. We cut ourselves off from the world, believing that we will find our answers and our happiness in that isolation.

So the ideas of both peace and war modify our social behavior. We cannot fight everyone and everything. Harmony in peace also does not give us struggle. It limits growth,  understanding and maturation.

Now there are many many things to fight against. First and foremost are parents and relatives, those that are closest to us in adolescence. We find peace and harmony in  friends. WE fight together, Rebels united against a common course, inexperience.

But a time comes when we again want to break free into what we consider total individuality, we want to think our own thoughts, live our own dreams, pay for our own mistakes

Again we take up arms. Against our former friends and allies. Assault them with radical thoughts and feelings, societal norms, because we are individuals, we want anarchy, everything done for individual gain, individual reasons. 

Hopefully, at some point, we we come to the onerous conclusion of how futile all the rebellions have been. How difficult and tiresome it is ruling alone .Lonesome, barren and unforgiving. 

We want to separate and distance ourselves, create our own worlds  we command. Masters or our own domain. 

So we parlay

We play tit for tat. We negotiate terms, what are willing to give up in exchange for love and acceptance from others. we make new friends , new loves. We revel in the bounty of ideas, adventures and fun. And believe all previous rebellions, all struggles have brought us to this one particular spot at this one particular time, and isn't it wonderful. 

No need to struggle, the conflict stops. 

And now we are happy, aren't we? 

A little worn out and tired. All reserves of energy have been spent. There is no more replenishment left. NO struggle left, perchance no will. 

But what is life without struggle, conflict. It brings change, begetting action, thinking and acting. It enlivens thought, philosophical meaning, societal bounds and the desire to survive and make the world a better place, but first it has to be a worse place.
