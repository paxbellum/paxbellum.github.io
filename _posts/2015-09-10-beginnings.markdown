The concepts of war and conflict has been well discoursed upon, both historically and in modernity. Literature shows us that there is much more to both than just the physical atrocities of fighting. There is this other whole dimension of internalized war that takes place within our  own psyches. Physical and mental conflicts constantly arise throughout life, and wreak havoc upon our perception of how we think our very own lives ought to be. 

Firstly, you might argue that the sole point of conflict is to overcome it. Stories abound about people and the process of overcoming, resolution, that comes at the end of the conflict. We can, and often, struggle more with ourselves than outside influences. We cut ourselves off from the world, believing that we will find our answers and our happiness in that isolation.

So the ideas of both peace and war modify our social behavior. We cannot fight everyone and everything. Harmony in peace also does not give us struggle. It limits growth,  understanding and maturation.

Now there are many many things to fight against. First and foremost are parents and relatives, those that are closest to us in adolescence. We find peace and harmony in  friends. WE fight together, Rebels united against a common course, inexperience.

But a time comes when we again want to break free into what we consider total individuality, we want to think our own thoughts, live our own dreams, pay for our own mistakes

Again we take up arms. Against our former friends and allies. Assault them with radical thoughts and feelings, societal norms, because we are individuals, we want anarchy, everything done for individual gain, individual reasons. 

Hopefully, at some point, we we come to the onerous conclusion of how futile all the rebellions have been. They have merely ostracized us. We feel like a castaway, but realize that we have done it to ourselves. 

So we parlay. We play tit for tat. We negotiate terms, what are willing to give up in exchange for love and acceptance from others. we make new friends , new loves. We revel in the bounty of ideas, adventures and fun. And believe all previous rebellions, all struggles have brought us to this one particular spot at this one particular time, and isn't it wonderful. 

Naturally this has eliminated all of our underlying reasons of conflict, there is no longer any need to struggle, the conflict stops. The conflict stops? And now we are happy, aren't we? Happy?

But what is life without struggle, conflict. It brings change, begetting action, thinking and acting. It enlivens thought, philosophical meaning, societal bounds and the desire to survive and make the world a better place, but first it has to be a worse place.
