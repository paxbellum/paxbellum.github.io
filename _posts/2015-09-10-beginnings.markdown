The concept of Peace and War is old trope, for sure. Militarily the concept is well ingrained both historically and in modernity. Eve in literature we can see the war of man and his psyche. The struggle of life's adventure can often wreak havoc upon individuals. The purpose of struggle then is conflict juxtaposed with its absence. 
   
  The point of struggle, assumed, is to overcome conflict. And stories about people are about the process, that resolution, that comes at the end of the conflict. We can, and often, struggle more with ourselves than outside influences. We cut ourselves off from the world, believing that we will find our answers and our happiness in that isolation.
