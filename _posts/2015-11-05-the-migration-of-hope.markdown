My father is dead.

So are my mother, brother and sister. 

My whole family. 

Gone. 


I used to be a kid. 

A normal, happy kid. 

I laughed and played. 

I used to run all day. 


I loved to listen to the stories my father told. 

Every night he would tuck us all in, sit beside us and we would all fall asleep to the sound of his voice. 

His voice is silent now. 


My mother was the best mother in the world. 

Not because of any particular thing she did, it’s because she did everything. 

She could do anything. 

Except come back from the dead. 


I had a little brother and sister, five and three years old. 

I was the oldest. 

I was supposed to protect them. 

I failed. 


I remember waking up. It was black. Dirt and dust were everywhere. The screaming wouldn’t stop. This high pitched wailing, unceasing and full of heartbreak. It wrenched, tore and dislodged your very soul.
It was me. 

They found me screaming. 

That was the last sound I ever made.
