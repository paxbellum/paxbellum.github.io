One day the earth tipped over.
No, seriously just plunk, on her side
Like a drunk falling off a sidewalk
You can imagine my surprise, 
Ok well everyones surprise and having the rotational effect of the earth weaken
Revolutions per minute were down, 
Which of course means gravity weakens
At first I thought it was a direct result of the new steroids I was taking
Because everything seemed so much lighter
But then I noticed I had trouble walking down the street
Even when I was sober
Imagine That!
Now, I’m not one for much of tv or fox news, those phony little prick bastards
So I didn’t really pay attention
And that Mrs. Davies, she always tell you a yarn longer than gigantic sea squid, that’s at least 80 feet mind you
SO I didn’t pay her no mind when she was trying tell me some malarky about the earth tipping over
I figured it was just her that was tipped
If you know what I mean
 
So anyways there I was thinking my doping was going good
I was on top of the world, literally at a least one point in the day
 I mean I guess if you think about it, not scientifically of course, 
You think that your entire perspective would change and things would feel different
But not much seemed to change, at first anyways

People, and by people I pretty much just mean me, just went on with their lives as normal
I went to work, if you could call it that, mostly just me hanging around the corner looking to sell
Customers didn’t really drop off much, a few were scared the first couple of days
But they came back around after a bit
Once they realized that is was in fact not the end of the world

The funny thing is just thinking about the earth now, like its laid down on its side for a rest of some sort
Well, it kind of fucks with your mind
Like, why the fuck did it do that
Invariably followed by, are we all going to die?
Nope, we sure didn’t
At least not yet
As long as well don’t start offing each other
Really the problem is all psychological
That sudden realization that hey were on a fucking planet that just fell the fuck over
Seriously, what happened?
That’s some crazy shit right
Why did it tip over anyways?
There wasn’t any explosion or impact with some other planetary body
That’s what all those scientists say
And hey, they’re supposed to be smart and know this shit, right?

So any who this psycho babble bullshit starts poppin up
And you know all those nutters out there are  preaching this end of days 
Repent for your sins crap
Funny enough my business starts pickin up from them bastards
Guess they can’t cope

I mean seriously life goes on right
Yeah yeah sure the earths gonna start cooling off because some hot mess at the center of it is out of alignment
That’s what one of them scientists said anyways
Maybe he’s lying his ass off so he can keep some sweet gig
Lecturing and tellin everyone what to believe
Big bucks I bet

But hey, my business is booming
People scared as shit that they got nothing to lose
Want to get that shit to fuck with their minds so they don’t give a shit either
Fuck it

I figure make my money while I can
It’s all about economics, I learned this shit in sixth grade
Coincidentally about the time I dropped out of school
Who needs that shit anyways.
Them smart ass motherfuckers can’t fix it either
Guess they ain’t gotta worry about student debt no more though

So anyways its all about supply and demand
I’ve got the supply, but shit that demand is outta sight now
Nobody, I mean nobody wants to think about the future

I guess they just get all depressed thinkin ‘bout the tilted earth
And worried about what will happen to the future, if there is one
I say live your fuckin life today and enjoy the ride

It’s kind like a tilt-a-whirl now, right?
